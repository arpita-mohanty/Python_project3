# Email Spam Classification using Neural Networks


This project implements a simple neural network to classify emails as spam or not spam using a dataset of email features. The model is trained using a custom implementation of a two-layer neural network with sigmoid activation and backpropagation.


#Features:

Uses Scikit-learn for data preprocessing and feature scaling

Implements a custom neural network with one hidden layer

Trains the model using gradient descent with backpropagation

Evaluates model performance using accuracy score

Utilizes NLTK for potential text processing (optional)
